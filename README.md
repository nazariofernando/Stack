# Stack
Stack practice problem for compsci competitions taken from ITMOx: I2CPx (edx.org)

**Prompt:**

Implement a stack which supports push and pop operations. For every pop operation, output its result.

Input
The ﬁrst line of the input ﬁle contains a single integer number N (1 <= N <= 10^6) – the number of commands. N lines follow, each line contains exactly one command. There are the following commands:

+x: push x to the stack. Every  will be an integer such that |x| <= 10^9. The symbol + and the number will be separated by exactly one white space.

-: pop an element from the stack. It is guaranteed that this operation will never be executed on an empty stack. There will be at least one such operation.

Output:
Output the integers popped from the stack, one per line, in the order they were popped.
